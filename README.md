This ePortfolio was created to showcase the skills I've gained through my years at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) while pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The ePortfolio will demonstrate my ability to communicate in a professional capacity and will include written narratives of my journey to enhance three artifacts. The narrative will also detail how I reached all the course outcomes and the completed enhancements will demonstrate my skills in three different catagories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

    <h2 style="color:darkblue; text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Welcome! This ePortfolio was created to showcase the skills I've gained through my years at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) while pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
    The ePortfolio will demonstrate my ability to communicate in a professional capacity and will include written narratives of my journey to enhance three artifacts.
    The narrative will also detail how I reached all the course outcomes and the completed enhancements will demonstrate my skills in three different catagories:
    Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.</p>

    <h2 id="assesment" style="color:darkblue">1. Professional Self-Assesment</h2>
    <img src="images/assesment.png">
    <p>I have been in the Computer Science program at SNHU since February of 2022.  In these past two years, I’ve learned how to program in three different languages; Python, Java, and C++. Additionally, I was introduced to the basics of SQL and JavaScript. I’ve also developed code in various environments such as PyCharm, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter, and a Linux terminal. Additionally, I learned the importance of and application of the software development lifecycle. This includes understanding client requirements, developing bug-free code that follows best practices, and continuously testing code for vulnerabilities and functionality issues.</p>
  <p>My career plans are to enter cybersecurity, machine learning, or data analytics. Each artifact I chose to enhance for the ePortfolio aligns with my career aspirations and showcases my abilities for the respective career path. Working with Python in my first enhancement helps prepare me for a potential role in machine learning as it is a commonly used programming language in that field. Additionally, my understanding of algorithms that is demonstrated with my second enhancement is an important skill to have when working with machine learning programs. As for cybersecurity, following coding best practices is the first step in the lines of defense. By delivering well written code that has been thoroughly tested for functionality issues and has all necessary input validation, I will help prepare myself for a potential career in cybersecurity. Lastly, understanding how to work with databases aligns with the type of work I would be doing in a data analytics job. Demonstrating my skills of Python, algorithms, and databases shows my ability to perform the duties of my possible career specializations. </p>

    <h2 style="color:darkblue; text-align:center;">About</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Welcome! This ePortfolio was created to showcase the skills I've gained through my years at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) while pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
    The ePortfolio will demonstrate my ability to communicate in a professional capacity and will include written narratives of my journey to enhance three artifacts.
    The narrative will also detail how I reached all the course outcomes and the completed enhancements will demonstrate my skills in three different catagories:
    Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.</p>

    <h2 id="assesment" style="color:darkblue">1. Professional Self-Assesment</h2>
    <img src="images/assesment.png">
    <p>I have been in the Computer Science program at SNHU since February of 2022.  In these past two years, I’ve learned how to program in three different languages; Python, Java, and C++. Additionally, I was introduced to the basics of SQL and JavaScript. I’ve also developed code in various environments such as PyCharm, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter, and a Linux terminal. Additionally, I learned the importance of and application of the software development lifecycle. This includes understanding client requirements, developing bug-free code that follows best practices, and continuously testing code for vulnerabilities and functionality issues.</p>
  <p>My career plans are to enter cybersecurity, machine learning, or data analytics. Each artifact I chose to enhance for the ePortfolio aligns with my career aspirations and showcases my abilities for the respective career path. Working with Python in my first enhancement helps prepare me for a potential role in machine learning as it is a commonly used programming language in that field. Additionally, my understanding of algorithms that is demonstrated with my second enhancement is an important skill to have when working with machine learning programs. As for cybersecurity, following coding best practices is the first step in the lines of defense. By delivering well written code that has been thoroughly tested for functionality issues and has all necessary input validation, I will help prepare myself for a potential career in cybersecurity. Lastly, understanding how to work with databases aligns with the type of work I would be doing in a data analytics job. Demonstrating my skills of Python, algorithms, and databases shows my ability to perform the duties of my possible career specializations. </p>
    
    <h2 id="review" style="color:darkblue">2. Code Review Video</h2>
    <img src="images/review.png" style="width:700px;height:500px;">
    <p>In my code review video, I discuss the original three artifacts, their purpose and functionalities as well as a walkthrough of the code, and my enhancement plan for all three. The code review video can be found

    <h2 id="artifact1" style="color:darkblue">3. Artifact 1: Text Based Game</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/anaidrdz/anaidrdz.github.io/blob/main/artifacts/Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering/TextBasedGame.py" target="_blank">
          <span class="description" style="font-size: 40px">Text Based Game</span>
        </a>
    <p>The first artifact I chose was the final project for the course IT-140: Introduction to Scripting. The artifact is a text-based game written in Python and was originally developed in April of 2022. I felt very inclined to and excited about choosing this particular artifact because I had a lot of fun creating the first time around but knew very well that the code written was not up to professional coding standards. I selected this artifact because I knew it was the assignment I could improve on the most and fully reflect how much I’ve learned these past 2 years. The course outcomes I planned to accomplish were:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</p>
        </li>
      </ol> 

</p>
    
    <h2 id="enhancement1" style="color:darkblue">4. Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/anaidrdz/anaidrdz.github.io/blob/main/enhancements/Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering/main.py" target="_blank">
      <span class="description" style="font-size:35px">Text Based Game Enhanced</span>
    </a>
    <p>In my first enhancement, I demonstrated my ability to create code that follows best practices through readability, reusability, and in-line commenting. My main focus when enhancing this artifact was creating reusable code because the original program contained most of the code inside the main function. In my first term here at SNHU I learned what functions were and their importance in creating reusable and clean code but I had not fully understood how to use them. Through various courses, I began relying on the creation of classes and functions to create reusable code and I wanted to apply these skills to this artifact. The text based game has significantly improved on both the developers side and user end. As a developer, I was able to create code that was easy to follow, reuse, and was properly commented to explain the purpose of all of its features. As a user, I was able to play a more exciting game and even play two different difficulty levels that made the game more fun to play.</p>
    <p>I decided to create an additional difficulty level for my enhancement as well because I could demonstrate how reusable my code was by calling the same functions for two different levels of difficulty. This showcased I accomplished the first course outcome:
Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
The second course outcome
Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  
was met through proper in-line commenting and the enhanced explanation about the goal and rules of the game to the user. I edited the text that the reader was presented at the start of the game in order to better explain what their expected input was as well as the game’s story.
